## Examples in javascript 

### Additional guidelines for javascript examples 

- Example should consist of either single HTML files, folder with HTML and js files or single js files 
- HTML files should work by serving the root of the repository over port 800, e.g with python `http.server`:
  ```
  python3 -m http.server
  ```
  this is needed to be able to access the `data/` folder.
- Examples consisting of single js files should be runnable as Node.js scripts
