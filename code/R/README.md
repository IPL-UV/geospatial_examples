## Examples in R 

This folder contains examples in handling geospatial data with the 
R programming language. 

### Additional guidelines for R examples  

- If not specified otherwise examples should work with latest R release 
  as in <https://cran.r-project.org/>. Currently `R-4.1.0`. 
- packages should be loaded at the beginning of the example file. 
- packages which are not available from CRAN should be identified and 
  the alternative installation procedure should be described in the comment.   
- files should be runnable from the root of the repository, e.g. 
  ```
  Rscript code/R/crop_raster.R
  ```

### List of examples

- [`crop_raster.R`](crop_raster.R): crop a raster with the `raster` package.
