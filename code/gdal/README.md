## Examples in gdal 


GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data, which can 
be considered the **state of the art** for geospatial data manipulation. 
Here with `gdal` we refer to the command line interface which is 
referenced as _Programs_ in the GDAL website <https://gdal.org/programs>.
